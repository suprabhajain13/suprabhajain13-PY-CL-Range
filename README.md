# PY-CL-Range

## Overview

This project explores the usage of the range function in Python. The range function is commonly used to generate sequences of integers. This project includes examples of different ways to use the range function and demonstrates how to work with the generated sequences.

## Files

### app.py

The app.py file serves as the main entry point for the project. It contains examples of using the range function to generate sequences of integers and convert them into tuples.

### lab.py

The lab.py file contains the implementations of methods related to working with the range function. It includes functions to generate sequences of integers using range and convert them into different data structures.

### lab_test.py

The lab_test.py file contains unit tests for the functions defined in lab.py. It ensures that the implemented functions behave as expected by testing them with various input cases.
